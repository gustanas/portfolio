          <p>
          Sentiance develops a mobile SDK which interprets sensor data in real-time to infer user location, transport mode and base-level activity.
          </p>

          <p>The company turns these IOT sensor data into rich insights about peopleâ€™s behavior and real-time context. Their SDK is used by +100K users. 
          </p>

          <p>
          My task was to accurately track the user location during the different execution states of an iOS app. I stored and uploaded sensor data with low battery impact (~5% daily). I increased the test coverage by 50% and then refactored the whole SDK.
          </p>

          <p>
          I also served as squad lead and had to conduct international clients support calls. I interviewed dozens of candidates and coordinated the work among the different iOS developers.
