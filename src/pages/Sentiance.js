        <p>
        Sentiance develops a mobile SDK which interprets sensor data in real-time to infer user location, transport mode and base-level activity.
        </p>

        <p>The company turns these IOT sensor data into rich insights about peopleâ€™s behavior and real-time context. Their SDK is used by +100K users. 
        </p>

        <p>
         My task was to accurately track the user location in the background. I stored and uploaded sensor data with low battery impact (~5% daily). I increased the test coverage by 50% and then refactored the whole SDK.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also had to conduct international clients support calls and interviewed dozens of candidates.
